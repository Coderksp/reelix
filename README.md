## ✨ Features

- **Hover-to-play trailers** — hover any movie poster and its YouTube trailer fades in and plays, muted and looping, right inside the card.
- **Live search** — debounced search across the full TMDB catalogue with an animated results grid.
- **Curated rails** — trending, critically acclaimed, action, sci-fi, comedy, horror and more, each in a smooth horizontal scroller.
- **Animated everything** — staggered entrance animations, scroll-triggered reveals, an ambient drifting-colour background, and micro-interactions throughout (Framer Motion).
- **Responsive + accessible** — works down to mobile, keyboard-focusable, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 2. Get a free TMDB API key
1. Create an account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
2. Go to **Settings → API** and request an API key (v3 auth)
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env

```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Run it

Open the local URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## 💡 How hover-to-play works

When the mouse enters a card, a 600 ms timer starts (so quickly scanning across posters doesn't trigger every trailer). If the mouse stays, the app fetches that movie's trailer key from `GET /movie/{id}/videos`, then fades in a muted, looping, controls-free YouTube embed scaled to fill the card. Trailer keys are cached so re-hovering is instant.
